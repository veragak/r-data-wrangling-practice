# R Analytics Practice Labs

This repository contains a collection of 10 small R exercises completed as part 
of my programming coursework. All task descriptions have been rewritten for this 
repository and do not contain original course material.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate foundational skills in:

- data cleaning  
- aggregation & summarization  
- base R manipulation  
- tidyverse manipulation (where allowed)  
- handling missing values  
- simple explorations of prices, promotions, and demographics  
- basic statistical logic  

Each assignment is contained in its own folder with:

- a clean R script  
- a short README describing the tasks  
- (optional) datasets or links
