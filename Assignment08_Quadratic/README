# Assignment 8 — Quadratic Functions in Base R

This assignment implements two custom R functions using only **base R**, following the course requirements. The goals are to compute quadratic expressions, solve quadratic equations, validate inputs, handle errors properly, and verify that computed roots satisfy the original equation.
